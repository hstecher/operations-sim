## Image Requirements

- **Format**: PNG with alpha transparency
- **Size**: 512x512 pixels recommended (or larger, will be scaled)
- **Background**: Transparent (remove black space)
- **Quality**: High resolution with visible structure and detail
- **Colors**: Keep natural astronomical colors (reds for hydrogen, blues for oxygen, etc.)

## Finding Real Images

### Best Sources

1. **Hubble Space Telescope**: https://esahubble.org/images/
   - Search by object name (e.g., "M31")
   - Download high-resolution versions
   - Many have transparent background versions

2. **NASA Image Library**: https://images.nasa.gov/
   - Professional quality
   - Public domain

3. **ESO (European Southern Observatory)**: https://www.eso.org/public/images/
   - Ground-based telescope images
   - Excellent quality

4. **APOD Archives**: https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/archivepix.html
   - Search by object name
   - Credit the photographer if using amateur images

### Processing Tips

- Use image editing software (GIMP, Photoshop) to:
  - Remove black backgrounds (use color range selection)
  - Add alpha transparency
  - Crop to square aspect ratio
  - Adjust levels for better visibility

## How DSOs Display

- **Acquisition View**: Fuzzy patches of light (realistic appearance)
  - Nebulae appear pinkish/reddish
  - Galaxies appear bluish/white
- **Telescope View**: Detailed images with structure and color
- **Exposure View**: Accumulated detail over time (like real astrophotography!)

## Fun Facts for Kids

- **M31** can be seen with the naked eye on a dark night!
- **M42** is a stellar nursery where new stars are born
- **M51** was the first "spiral nebula" ever discovered
- **M57** will fade away in about 10,000 years
- **M1** is expanding at 1,500 km/second!
- **M8** contains the brightest open cluster in the sky
- **NGC 7293** is called the "Eye of God" or "Eye of Sauron"
