# Planet Images

## Image Requirements

- **Format**: PNG (supports transparency/alpha channel)
- **Size**: 512x512 pixels recommended (or any square size)
- **Background**: Transparent (alpha channel) - backgrounds will be removed when displaying
- **Naming**: Must match exact filenames:
  - `mercury.png`
  - `venus.png`
  - `mars.png`
  - `jupiter.png`
  - `saturn.png`
  - `uranus.png`
  - `neptune.png`
  - `ufo.png` (secret Easter egg for kids to find!)

## Recommended Sources

1. **NASA Image Galleries**: https://images.nasa.gov/
2. **Solar System Scope**: High-quality planet textures
3. **Wikipedia**: Most planet images are public domain

## Tips

- Use high-resolution images with good detail (clouds, storms, surface features)
- Circular/disk format works best
- Images with transparent backgrounds look best in the telescope view
- Make sure to crop to a square before saving as PNG

## How Images Display

- **Acquisition View**: Planets show as colored dots (small)
- **Telescope View**: Planets show the actual image (large and detailed)
- **Exposure View**: Planets show the actual image (accumulated over time)
